<h1>Psychic Game</h1>

<p>Random letter is generated, and the user has 10 guesses to guess the letter. After 10 guesses, the game is restarted, and the game starts over.</p>

<br>

<p>Wins and losses are tracked</p>

<br>

<p>Onscreen keyboard is generated using jQuery, and the keyboard can be hidden, and the user can guess using a keyboard. <b>Special thanks to Clayton Pabst & Alex Ulfich for help with the game logic</b></p>

<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>

<li>jQuery</li>
<li>Boostrap</li>
</ul>
