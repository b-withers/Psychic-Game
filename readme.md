<h1>Psychic Game</h1>

<p>Random letter is generated, and the user has 10 guesses to guess the letter. After 10 guesses, the game is restarted, and the game starts over.</p>

<br>

<p>Wins and losses are tracked</p>

<br>

<p>Onscreen keyboard is generated using jQuery, and the keyboard can be hidden, and the user can guess using a keyboard. <b>Special thanks to Clayton Pabst & Alex Ulfich for help with the game logic</b></p>

<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>Boostrap</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>Sounds are included for clicking onscreen keyboard, page open (known bug that it will not always play), wins and losses</p>

<br>

<p>Future development:</p>

<ul>
<li>Local Storge to track wins / losses</li>
<li>Difficulty levels</li>
<li>Hints on how close you are to level</li>
<li>Percentage of times won / lost</li>
</ul>

<p>app is mobile responsive using bootstrap and media queries. You can also add the app to your homescreen so it saves the link as an "app" on your homescreen. I hide the gif on mobile, as well as the button to hide the keyboard, this way the entire app fits on the screen.</p>
